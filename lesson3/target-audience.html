    <h3>Target Audience</h3>
    <p>The target audience of First Watch Weather is anyone from the local community with an interest in local weather.
      Those with an interest in local weather could include outdoor recreation enthusiasts, those whose jobs require
      them to work outside, and generally anyone who will be outside during any point throughout the course of the day.
      The website will target audience members who are seeking information using the internet. They could be accessing
      the website from a desktop, laptop, tablet, or mobile phone.</p>
    <h3>Personas</h3>
    <h4>Rick</h4>
    <p>Rick is a 38 years old and single. He has a bachelor’s degree in business administration and is a project manager at
      a small advertising agency. He is an outdoor recreation enthusiast and seeks to know what the weather conditions
      are so that he can plan his weekend activities. Rick uses the computer at work to check the weather.</p>
    <h4>Susan</h4>
    <p>Susan is 31 years old. Susan has some college education, but she doesn’t have a degree. She is a stay-at-home mom
      with two small children—a four-year-old boy named Nate and a two-year-old girl named Jinny. The children love to
      play outside, so Susan likes to know the weather conditions so she knows how to dress her children. She accesses
      the site from her phone.</p>

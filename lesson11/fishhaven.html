      <h4 class="author">by Jennifer Jenkins</h4>
      <p>Ed McCurty, long time resident of Fish Haven, likes to tell a story about a fish he once caught&mdash;or nearly
        caught. About 20 years ago, rainbow trout were pretty rare in Bear Lake, but every now and then someone would
        snag one of these rare beauties. Ed explains that he was fishing one quiet afternoon. He hadn't had much luck
        and was about to go home when he felt a tug on his line. When he started to reel in, whatever was on his line
        gave a fierce tug, and he almost lost control, so he knew that whatever was on the other end was
        big&mdash;bigger than anything he had ever caught before. The struggle that ensued was the fiercest fight of his
        life. Ed says he nearly lost his pole&mdash;twice. Then, when he had reeled the line in enough that the beast
        was near the surface, there was a moment that the fish jumped out of the water in a graceful arc that seemed to
        stretch out time. Ed says he got a very clear view of the monster. It was a magnificent rainbow trout at least
        three feet long and probably forty pounds&mdash;bigger than any he had ever seen. At the moment the fish reached
        the peak of the arc, the fish made eye contact with Ed, and seemed to communicate that today wasn't the day he
        would be caught. When the fish hit the surface of the water, the line suddenly went slack. Ed expected the line
        had broken, but when he reeled in, the hook was still attached and <i>clean</i>. Ed has no explanation for it,
        other than to say that the fish was just plain stubborn enough to not get caught. He believes that the fish is
        still out there, and he still holds out hope that he will one day get the one that got away.</p>
